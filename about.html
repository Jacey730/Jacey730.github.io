            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <h2>
                  Hello!  I am Jason Wissinger, a recent graduate from Waynesburg University as of December 2022.  
              My degree is a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.  My main hobbies
              are going to the gym or playing video games in my spare time.  I frequently go visit my beautiful 
              girlfriend at Waynesburg on the weekends.  From the time I graduated until now, I have been practicing 
              my coding skills in various different languages and methods in an effort to further enhance my chances 
              of catching some lucky company's eye.  Codecademy.com's Full-Stack Career Path has been my main method 
              of improving, however, leetcode and the creation of this website has helped me even more. 
              Some notable qualities I have gathered throughout my experiences are a determination to succeed, a 
              passion for learning, and a dedication to the things I find important: relationships, health, work, and 
              finding a balance between the three.
